<h1>MDPs</h1>
<p>In this assignment, you'll implement value iteration and policy iteration
as per the slide deck covered in class.  Note that in contrast to the
code from the 4th edition of the book, here, rewards are defined over states
(not over state, action, successor-state triples). Further, the utility of
a particular state includes the immediate reward obtained in that state.</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<ol>
<li>Download the stub <code>mdp.py</code>.</li>
<li>Look through the code.  I've written some functionality,
   and the goal is for you to complete it.</li>
<li>As before the code assumes four spaces of indentation.
   Set your editor appropriately, this is the default for many.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Command Line Invocation</h1>
<p>Value and Policy iteration should be implemented as top-level functions.
These functions will be called directly from the test harness.  However,
a "main" method has also been provided that may help you test your code on
your own.</p>
<p>Usage instructions are given when you invoke the function at the command line
with no arguments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>python mdp.py
    usage: mdp.py [-h] [--quiet] [--gamma GAMMA] {policy,value} {4x3,2x2}
    mdp.py: error: too few arguments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the first required argument selects the function to run, the second
   identifies which of the two provided environments to use.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>python msttt.py policy 4x3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for example, runs policy iteration on the 4x3 environment</p>
<h1>Turn in your code</h1>
<p>Submit your code via Autolab. Current tests are very limited, but will be improved over the next few days. If you think there's a problem with the tests,
please check the inline code specification carefully and recheck your
results.  You may also want to look at the specific test that it's failing
and try to reproduce that result. If it still looks like the tests are
incorrect, send me a message and if you're correct, I'm happy to give you
some extra credit points.</p>
